	      <p>The University of Georgia Redcoat Marching Band is the one and only official marching band at UGA. Its sole purpose is to cheer on the Georgia Bulldogs at every possible sporting event, especially football. Smaller portions of the band can be seen at Volleyball, Basketball, and Soccer games, as well as other events that put in a formal request for out prescence. Redcoats is made up of many unique and special sections including brass, woodwinds, drumline, and auxiliaries. All of these groups can be split into even smaller subgroups, but no matter how small we divide into, all 430 members come together to put on a show for all of Dawg Nation every Saturday between the hedges. </p>

	      <p>In 1905, the UGA Redcoat Band was started as a section of the UGA Military Department, as many modern marching bands of today began. During the next 100 years, the band grew from 20 to over 400 people, and from playing at baseball games to football. In the late 1900's, the new fight song "Glory Glory to Old Georgia" was composed and played. In 1955, the Redcoat Band as we know today was formed by the arrival of Roger Dancz and his wife Phyllis, who was to become the Director of the Auxiliaries. During this time, the band also went from "The Georgia Marching Band" to "The University of Georgia Dixie Redcoat Band." </p>

	      <h2>My Experience with Redcoats </h2>                                                                                                                                                                    
	      <p>My experience within the Redcoat Marching Band has been an... interesting experience, to say the least. To begin with, I'm not an instrument playing member of the band, as I am actually part of the Flagline. The University of Georgia Flagline is a subsection of the previously mentioned auxiliaries, with the other sections being the Georgettes, Majorettes, and our Feature Twirler. I have spun on the field from 2017 to present day, and I have one more season for the 2020-2021 school year. With practices being 2 and a half hours every Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday and with games all day on Saturday, it's been difficult to balance schoolwork, social life, and a part time job. I wouldn't have it any other way. Redcoats has given me some of the best friends I could ever ask for, a brotherhood that I never thought I would have, and a love for the Dawgs to last a lifetime. </p>
